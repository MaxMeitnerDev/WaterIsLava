# **·êÖ Description**
A simple plugin created for the first of April to make fun of your players. This plugin replaces water with lava, and lava with water for players (not visually). For the plugin to work, you need the minecraft server version 1.8+. You can get help on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/QVU7X9852n).
